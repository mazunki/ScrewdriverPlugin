## Source files

All actual code of this plugin that I made will be stored in this folder, probably singlehandedly under `./tech/mazunki/`, since that's the package I'm /////////////probably////////////// going to use for all the classes I implement. This corresponds to the generated classes, and the path/package format is reflected in `/classes/...` from this.
