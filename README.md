## ScrewdriverPlugin

A plugin made by mazunki as part of a server, with educational purposes. 

Possibly something good will come out of it, possibly not. Time will tell.

Use scripts to compile classes and jar-files for usage, make sure to download the necessary libraries/resources from Spigot. Further information about resources needed is found in lib folder. Look at `./scripts/` for a guide on how to build the plugin.

Nothing else than the latest version of jre8-OpenJDK-8-headless (1.8 64 bit) is necessary to compile the files.
