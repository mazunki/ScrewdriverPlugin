## Libraries

Libraries are downloaded with BuildTools, provided by Spigot at https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools. Once downloaded, you can compile the latest revision yourself with its tool, as explained there. 

As of version 1.15.2, the normal revision includes the API which we need, at $BUILDTOOLSPATH/Spigot/Spigot-API/target/spigot-api-$VERSION-$REVISION.jar. Copy this file to your lib folder. I will not be distributing this, this is your own resposibility. 

Currently, the Spigot-API is the only requirement.
